# Petz3Decompiled
I decompiled the Petz 3 Executable with Snowman ( https://derevenets.com/ ) and this is the output. 
If this means anything to anyone in reverse engineering the game, I hope it can help. 

# Info

To be honest I don't understand a line of this. This shit's way too advanced for me. 

I haven't modified this, I'm not an expert reverse engineerer or anything. 
I'm only doing this in the hopes it can help someone else to understand the code. 

It was compiled originally in Visual C++ 7 (the old one)

Original code copyright Ubisoft I guess? PF Magic is part of them now or gone. 
Either way Ubisoft can suck my Ubiballs.
